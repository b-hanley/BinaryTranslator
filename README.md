### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install your project.

## Usage

To translate decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2) use the function b10tob2(x).
To translate binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10) use the function b2tob10(x).
In both cases x is the integer you want to translate. Both return the desired value.
